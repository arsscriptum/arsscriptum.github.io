### REMAPS 
 
Reprogramming your OEM ECU with new characteristics, from tried and tested off-the-shelf tuning, to full custom, user specifiable packages, including on site tuning and support at the venue of your choice

Vehicle Tuning is achieved by taking the original parameters and changing them to something more suited to the enthusiast. Within the vehicle's ECU, is a memory section, usually a separate memory chip which stores both the program code on how to interpret and control the engine systems and also a data section, where the individual values are collected into "look up" tables. It is this reference section of tables, or "Maps", where the tuning takes place.


### Diagnostics and OBD II

Diagnostics is the in-built self checking facility (OBD - On Board Diagnostics) that has been built into ECUs since the '80's.

The standardisation of the plug to the OBD II (SAE J1962) and of communication protocols allowed electronics manufacturers to develop low cost Fault code readers that could read the OBD II DTCs.

A Scan Tool is any device which can check and retrieve fault codes. 


### Common Fault Codes & What They Mean To Your BMW 

With so many moving parts, there are countless fault codes that tell you what needs attention on your BMW. Your OBD system detects faults in your car and displays a trouble code that tells you and your mechanic what needs service in order to get your vehicle back on the road.

While there are many BMW fault codes, here are the most common fault codes and their meanings to watch out for in your Bimmer.

***BMW Fault Code: P1014***
If your BMW presents the fault code P1014, it's highly likely a result of an issue with your vehicle's valvetronic eccentric shaft sensor. â€œValvetronic Eccentric Shaft Sensor Reference is a general description for this particular code, with more specific diagnostics available from manufacturers and experienced European auto mechanics.

This code indicates that your vehicle is in need of immediate service from a BMW mechanic.

***BMW Fault Code: P1017***
When the P1017 fault code is displayed on a BMW, it indicates â€œValvetronic Eccentric Shaft Sensor Plausibility. This code, though similar, is not the same as P1014. It can be caused by particular conditions such as poor electrical connections in the shaft sensor or a missing reluctor on your BMW's valvetronic eccentric shaft sensor.

The fault code P1017 does indicate that your BMW requires attention and repair from a qualified BMW mechanic.

***BMW Fault Code: P1023***
When this code is displayed, it corresponds with the description: â€œValvetronic Adjustment Range. Similar to the codes above, this code is related to the health of your BMW's valvetronic eccentric shaft in the engine.
 
Once you've detected this fault code in your vehicle, it's important to have your BMW's P1023 code diagnosed by a qualified BMW mechanic in order to determine the exact cause and best course of action to repair the issue in your vehicle.
 
***BMW Fault Code: P1030***
The valvetronic system in your BMW's engine is designed to improve fuel economy and emissions. In addition to this, the valvetronic system decreases frequent need for your BMW to engage the throttle body. Unfortunately, many fault codes are related to this particular element in the engine, including P1030 which indicates the description â€œValvetronic Monitoring Sluggish Movement. This means that a few possible things could be happening within your engine: faulty valvetronic motor, eccentric motor harness is either open, shorted, or the electrical connection with the motor circuit is insufficient.
 
***BMW Fault Code: P10DF***
The P10DF fault code indicates â€œValvetronic Overload Protection Output Stage System Shutdown. This first presents itself as the check engine light, and then, once checked with an OBD system, the code P10DF will appear. Possible causes of this include user abuse on the engine, frequent open-loop or high resistance in the valvetronic system.
 
Once you've found the fault code in your vehicle, it's important to have your BMW assessed by a BMW mechanic in order to determine the cause and best way to repair the issue in your vehicle.
 
***BMW Fault Code: P10E0***
When the valvetronic actuator mode does not meet standard functionality for your BMW, the engine control module will indicate the fault code P10E0, which means â€œValvetronic Overload Protection Control Motor System Shutdown. This is typically the result of poor electrical connections or an open or shorted circuit within the valvetronic actuator motor.
 
When you detect this fault code, visit one of our experienced European auto mechanics to receive service that will ensure your BMW's issues are resolved.
 
***BMW Fault Code: P10E1***
A P10E1 fault code means â€œValvetronic System No Travel Detected, which is typically the result of poor electrical connections or an open or shorted circuit within the valvetronic actuator motor. When detected, it's highly recommended that you seek immediate attention from a certified auto mechanic, ideally one that is experienced in working with the unique systems within European cars, such as BMW, Audi and Lexus.
 
***BMW Fault Code: P10E7***
The fault code P10E7 references the description â€œValvetronic Overload Protection Output Stage Overload. This is likely caused by a faulty valvetronic actuator motor, which affects the timing of your engine's intake and exhaust valves, leading to a reduction in the quality of your BMW's performance.
 
***BMW Fault Code: P10E8***
When you notice the fault code P10E8 on your BMW diagnostics, this means a â€œValvetronic Control Motor Overload. This code arises when your engine's overload protection is triggered and demonstrates that the health of your motor is compromised, often from a faulty motor, motor harness or electrical connection.
